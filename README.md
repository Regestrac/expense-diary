# Expense Diary

This is an app to keep track of all our expenses in our day-to-day life.

This app is built using React and TypeScript. Apart from that it has Redux toolkit for state management, React-hook-form forms, Reactstarp for some styles and yup for form validation. This has eslint configured with airbnb styles for better code formation. It stores saved data in localStorage of our device.
